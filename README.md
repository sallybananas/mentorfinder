# Mentor Finder
A fullstack Mentor match making application using the Express package for Node.js!

Check out the deployed app on Heroku [here](https://git.heroku.com/protected-refuge-32871.git
)!

This app uses Express to serve 2 static HTML files and 2 API routes to get and post data.

Note that data is not persistent, but rather stored in an object in `mentors.js` for your current session.


# Instructions
After cloning down the repo to your laptop, run `npm install` to download the Node dependencies.
Then, be sure to serve the app in `localhost:8080` in your browser.
